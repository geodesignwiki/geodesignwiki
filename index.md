## Welcome to GeodesignWiki.com ... a volunteer supported wiki developed by an ever-expanding group of planning and design professionals interested in the subject of geodesign.

The purpose of this site is three-fold ...

- to introduce the subject of geodesign, what it means, and some of its implications, particularly for those working with geo-spatial data,
- to facilitate informed conversations about geodesign, and finally
- to encourage others interested in geodesign to play an active role in the development of this nascent field.

### We invite you to Join Us
